    "The following collection of IPython notebooks presents a short description of the analysis performed to match different data sets regarding the material properties of building components of a regional material catalog. These components are attributed to buildings in a digital cadastre. Aim of this analysis is the representation of a regional building typology for the estimation of residential heat demand and environmental impact of retrofits to the building stock.\n",

    "The notebooks are chronologically sorted following the undertaken analysis steps. These scripts make use of the different scripts available under the folder called `scripts`. This collection of notebooks should serve as complementary material to the paper with the same name. A fully reproducibility of the results is with the provided data not possible. The used digital cadastre for the city of Hamburg is not available for public use. The material data are directly retrieved from an internal MySQL database, this database is not available for public use, but the data itself is. Please contact the paper author for further details on the used method and data.\n",
